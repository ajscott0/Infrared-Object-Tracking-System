# Infrared-Object-Tracking-System
This project consists of a two small 180 degree servos each with 12 kg-cm of torque configured in a pan-tilt assembly. These servos are supplied by an external 6V power source. Mounted to the arm of the upper servo is an IR-cut switching camera capable of capturing video with and without ambient visible light. Data lines connect the servos to an Arduino Uno which is itself connected to the controlling computer via a USB-B connection. The Arduino, along with the simple program running on it, acts as a servo driver by translating serial commands received from the computer into PWM signals for the servos.
