# Infrared Object Tracking System
This project consists of a two small 180 degree servos each with 12 kg-cm of torque configured in a pan-tilt assembly. These servos are supplied by an external 6V power source. Mounted to the arm of the upper servo is an IR-cut switching camera capable of capturing video with and without ambient visible light. On the camera itself are six near infrared LEDs that flood a scene with NIR light, facilatating image processing and freeing the system of any reliance on ambient NIR light. Data lines connect the servos to an Arduino Uno which is itself connected to the controlling computer via a USB-B connection. The Arduino and its simple program (serial_servo_interface.ino) acts as a servo driver by translating serial commands received from the computer into PWM signals for the servos.

The control program is written in Python and uses the pySerial module for servo control. OpenCV is used for video capture, object detection, and video displaying. Any form of color detection was not possible for this system as infrared images do not haves color information, only intensity. Any .xml-saved Haar cascade can be used with this program through the use of OpenCV's CascadeClassifier class as seen in '''target_object.py'''. Object tracking was accomplished through the use of proportional control. The x and y values of the center of the frame is calculated as well as the x and y values of the center of the detected object. A pair of offsets between these values is then calculated (the error signal). The ajustment in servo angles requred to center the object in the frame is calculated by mulitplying this offset by the proportional gain constant Kp, the ratio of degrees of servo response to pixel offset.
